# Recent Favorites Player

This is a simple Python script to play your most recent favorited tracks on Spotify.

## Dependencies

You can install the dependencies with pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

You will need to create a Client ID and Client Secret on Spotify, and put those into your `config.json`. You will also need to whitelist a redirect uri (you can just use something on localhost).

## How to Use

Just run the Python script.

```
python3 player.py
```
